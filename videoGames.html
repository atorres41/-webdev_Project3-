          Video games have been a part of my life since I was a kid. I first started with many of the classics, such as Angry Birds
          and Doodle Jump on the early versions of the iPod. Additionally, I had access to older games from my dad's 
          Nintendo cartridge console, such as the original Super Mario Bros. I was fascinated by the hours spent playing,
          and I always wanted to explore more games as I grew older. Eventually I got my own consoles, such as 
          a Nintendo WiiU and a Nintendo Switch. Even as times have changed, I still appreciate the classics and look forward
          to what the future holds for gaming.

            Hollow Knight is a 2D action-adventure game created by Team Cherry, a small indie dev team of three people.
            You play as a silent bug knight exploring a fallen kingdom called Hallownest. The game is a metroidvania,
            where you discover interconnected regions, fight bosses, and gain new abilities to reach new areas.
            The hand-drawn art and soundtrack create a beautiful atmosphere. I first played it two years ago, and it was
            my introduction to the metroidvania genre. The lore is massive, and on my second playthrough I slowly pieced
            together the story. I haven’t fully completed it yet, but I’m enjoying taking my time with it.

          <p>
            Breath of the Wild is one of the more recent Zelda titles, released in 2017. I picked it up early,
            already being a Zelda fan, and was excited for its massive open world. You play as Link, awakening from a
            hundred-year slumber to find Hyrule devastated by Calamity Ganon. Using weapons, food, and abilities you discover,
            you explore the world and uncover the past. It's beautifully crafted with many secrets, shrines, and hours of
            gameplay. It's one of my most-played games, though I still haven’t played the sequel.

        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            Super Smash Bros came with my WiiU when I was younger. It features characters from Nintendo, Sega, Capcom,
            Konami, and more. I spent countless hours playing with friends and family, and it became one of the first games
            I played competitively. I remember playing with my dad for hours, improving my skills and learning new characters.
            It holds some of my favorite memories.

          <p>
            Dead By Daylight is a 4v1 game where four survivors attempt to repair generators to escape, while a killer hunts
            them down. Characters from Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Halloween, and others appear in the game. I started playing
            about two years ago, and it's been a fun game to play socially with others. I take breaks from it, but I recently
            picked it back up and have been enjoying it again.

        Even though the gaming industry has changed and may not hold the same nostalgia it once did, I still value the classics
        and the memories I’ve made through gaming. I’m excited to see how gaming continues to grow as technology evolves and improves.
